# Zach Redder's Website

This is a website hosted at [zachredder.com](zachredder.com) to showcase my developer work and startups I am working on. Viewers can get access to my newsletter as well by signing up with their email.

This website uses React.js for the frontend, a Firebase firestore database for the backend, and is hosted on Github Pages. It uses a cloud function for automatic emails when the user signs up to my newsletter and Firebase extensions to make sending emails seamless.
